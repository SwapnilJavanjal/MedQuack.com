            <p class="lead">New innovations require imagination. In the field of medical research, developing something great out of a new idea requires networking with other researchers who pursue similar content-related technological or structural topics. This is why MedQuack has built up a national and international network of research partnerships.</p><br></br>
			<p class="lead">Healthcare organizations are also adopting new applications, expanding service locations and sharing information with affiliate organizations such as healthcare specialists. All of these factors are exceeding the capabilities of legacy network technologies.</p>

              <li>It was founded to systematically link and strengthen the research and teaching activities</li><br>

            <h2>Software Designed Networking</h2>
			<br></br>
            <p class="lead">SDN uses virtualization to remove the intelligent management software from network hardware. By doing so, SDN creates a centralized, more intelligent, and easier managed network architecture. It allows network administrators to manage the network through abstraction which gives apps and programs a simplified platform to operate on.</p><br>
			<p class="lead">ONF breaks down SDN architecture as:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Directly programmable:</b> Network control is directly programmable because it is decoupled from forwarding functions.</li><br>
			<li><b>Centrally managed: </b>Network intelligence is (logically) centralized in software-based SDN controllers that maintain a global view of the network, which appears to applications and policy engines as a single, logical switch.</li><br>
			<li><b>Agile: </b>Abstracting control from forwarding lets administrators dynamically adjust network-wide traffic flow to meet changing needs.
