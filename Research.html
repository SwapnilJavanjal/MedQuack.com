            <h2>About our Research</h2>
            <p class="lead">Research at MedQuack acts as a bridge between science and clinical application. This comprehensive approach involves the application of the newest scientific findings in creative, fast, safe and above all useful ways for diagnosis and therapy.</p>
			<p class="lead">There are various areas of Research which includes:</p>
			<br></br>
            <ul>
              <li>Basic research - It is particularly important: it is the starting point for medical and technical innovations and aims to make sustainable developments for the benefit of our patients and society.</li>
              <li>Regenerative medicine - The aim of carrying out research on cell-based regenerative therapies is to heal previously incurable diseases or trauma through the restoration of diseased tissues or organs. This enables us to develop better treatments for patients with cancer, diabetes, body adiposity (obesity), Parkinson's or coronary heart disease.</li>
              <li>Personalized medicine - It aims to tailor the diagnosis, therapy and prevention of a disease to the individual genetic makeup of a patient. Our research in the field of personalized medicine is promising: it assures more accurate diagnoses, effective treatments, reliable risk assessments, better drugs and preventative measures.</li>
			  <li>Health services research - Health services research at MedQuack makes an essential contribution to the urgently needed modernization of the Swiss health care system. As an institution, we are developing concrete measures to optimize the quality of care and enhance efficiency.</li>
